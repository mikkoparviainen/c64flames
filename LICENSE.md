# C=64 Flames license

Basically, do what you want with it. I provide no support nor do I claim any responsibility over what the code does.

If you can find out some use for a C=64 effect which basically uses the whole capacity of the machine to display
an old demo effect, please, go ahead and use it somewhere. I wouldn't recommend taking any ideas about C=64
assembler from the code, though.

If you use it somewhere, I'd be very happy if you would give me credit for writing the code, but it's not
necessary.
